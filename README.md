# sudoku-solver-algorithm
A GUI app where you can write your sudoku to be solved using the backtracking algorithm.

## How to use
If you want to write a sudoku, just move your cursor to any square, click it, and then press a number. If that number is well-positioned, you will be able to see it on the board. But if that number can't go there you'll notice it. Once you have your sudoku ready, click `solve` and enjoy!
